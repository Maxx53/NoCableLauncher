# NoCableLauncher

Rocksmith 2014 Launcher for playing without original RealTone cable (nocable fix).

Working principle based on [this information](http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=63705&p=1006201#p1006201).

Multiplayer fix based on [AutoIt script](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1288526/rocksmith2014_nocable_pbs.au3) by [phobos2077](https://github.com/phobos2077).

This project uses [Core Audio API](https://github.com/morphx666/CoreAudio).

## Motivation

The game isn't developed to work with normal inputs, just because the game can't support random audio card or specific drivers configuration other to create a plug-and-play functionality as the RealTone cable offers along with the game.

Even if the 2014 remastered version offers a "mic input" option, it was meant for accoustic guitars, not electric. That means that the game won't reproduce any played notes/sounds because it will consider you will already be listening to your own accoustic guitar and will cover the songs guitar lines with a default audio.

This launcher allows you to use your own ipnut as if it was a RealTone cable by making the game "understand" that input as the Rocksmith product, so you get the game working perfectly with your common p2-p10 cable with all RealTone Cable available features.
