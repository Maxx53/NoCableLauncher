### Downloads

[NoCableLauncher Version 2.0](https://github.com/Mywk/NoCableLauncher/releases/download/2.0/NoCableLauncher.zip)

### Getting Started

1) Unpack the file "NoCableLauncher" to any folder.

2) Open the file "NoCableLauncher".

3) Run "NoCableLauncher" to play Rocksmith 2014 using your own audio interface!

Note: If you want to edit the settings again you can simply open the file "NCL_EditSettings.bat".

### Onboard soundcard

For those who, like me, don't have an extra audio capture device, there are two available options for single player mode:

###### Disable devices and re-enable on game close
All audio capture devices except the one used in game will be disabled when the game opens and re-enabled when the game closes.

Note: This prevents you from using other capture devices, for example if you want to be in a call while you play.

###### Prevent game from recognizing more devices
All audio capture devices except the one used in-game will be disabled when the game opens.

After the game is opened and in the main menu, press ALT-TAB to leave the game and press 'OK' on the message prompt, this will prevent the game from recognizing any other device and re-enable the disabled ones.

This allows you to use your microphone or any other device outside the game (assuming the game is not in exclusive mode).

### Setting Tips

![Settings Window](https://techcoders.net/images/content/ncl_screenshot.png)

* If you have Steam-licensed Rocksmith 2014, check the "Steam game" box, otherwise leave this checkbox and browse game EXE-file by pressing "..." button.
* "Device" —Åombobox contains all **active** found input audio devices in your system. Select the device connected to your guitar. If your device is not in the list, check the "Manual" box and set VID & PID values manually (find it in "Device manager"). VID & PID sets as "0000" means default non-USB input audio device, for example integrated Realtek microphone input.
* Press "OK" to save settings and close window or "Cancel" to close window without saving.
* To play multiplayer, check "Enable Multiplayer" box in the settings window and set **different** input devices for Player1 and Player2, otherwise multiplayer will not work! To activate Player 2 in game, select "Multiplayer" from game menu and press Ctrl+M (global hotkey).
